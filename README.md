# Monitoring-Services
People who have a second home are getting their mortgage and property tax bills in the mail there, and they keep missing payments since they don't get the mail on time when they are not there.

So I opened a business where I monitor my customers' mailboxes. (i check the mail, throw away garbage and send them an email with a scan of important stuff and they take it from there).
I employ residents from the area to do the work, they get $0.25 for each mile they travel, and I always put a 100% markup on the total money that the employee gets, but the markup is capped at $10.
And Iâ€™ve had success, so I decided to add 2 other services: cleaning, and monitoring (for thieves).
When a customer calls me I need their Name, Email, Address to monitor, CC to charge.
