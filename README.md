People who have a second home are getting their mortgage and property tax bills in the mail there, and they keep missing payments since they don't get the mail on time when they are not there.

So I opened a business where I monitor my customers' mailboxes. (i check the mail, throw away garbage and send them an email with a scan of important stuff and they take it from there).
I employ residents from the area to do the work, they get $0.25 for each mile they travel, and I always put a 100% markup on the total money that the employee gets, but the markup is capped at $10.
And I’ve had success, so I decided to add 2 other services: cleaning, and monitoring (for thieves).

When a customer calls me I need their Name, Email, Address to monitor, CC to charge.

—----------------------

The reports I need are as following:
What is my markup % for each Job sort low to high? I wanna see if it's sometimes too low and I should increase the cap.
I wanna make an employee of the month, Who’s my top employee (makes the most money)?.
I wanna fire the bottom 10 every month so the others will game up and check in more days and stay longer per day.
Which house is using only the mail service? Maybe I forgot to tell them that I also do cleaning and more.

Question: How do you calculate the mileage distance between one house and another?
Answer: The better answer at the end of the spec but for now to calculate the mileage we make a grid make which goes upto 100 on both directions and every house has an X and Y number, the amount of boxes you have to jump in the amount of mileage for the trip


Question: How do you calculate the first job of the day, since I don't know where they are coming from, I don't know the mileage and therefore the money amount to charge?
Answer: The first job of the day the employee does for free, to give back for the communities we serve.

Question: What is the smallest job you would accept?
Answer: $5

Question: How much do you charge for the other services?
Answer: oh sorry i forgot the explain, for each service for each mile the employee gets $0.25, so for a 10 mile ride where employee checks mail, cleans the house and confirms that all locks are good etc. they will get $7.50

Question: Do you operate 365 days a year?
Answer: No, We are close on Saturdays and Sundays

Question: Do you operate 24 hours a day?
Answer: No, We open 7 AM and close (not starting a new job after) 10 PM, and we wound not assign a job to an employee if they will arrive there after 10 PM

Question: How long does it take to travel 1 Mile?
Answer: 1 Minutes

Question: Would you go to the same house twice a day?
Answer: Only to do a service that we haven't done this day already

See below an illustration on how to calculate distance between houses.
In this scenario we are going from House A located on 8-4  to house B located at 4-9, we have to move 9 boxes (miles) to get from House A to Hous B.
